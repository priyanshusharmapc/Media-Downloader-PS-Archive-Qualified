# Audit Remediation Status

This list distinguishes implementation, focused regression and final qualification. A local PASS does not close a release gate until the exact final source commit has passed authoritative CI, target-host acceptance and final package sealing.

| ID | Implementation | Focused regression | Final qualification |
|---|---|---|---|
| MDPS-AUDIT-001 | IMPLEMENTED | TESTED: metadata-readable truncation rejected; sync repairs damaged canonical media | QUALIFIED by final CI and final target/live evidence |
